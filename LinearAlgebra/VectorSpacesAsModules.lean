# Path

* 1.) We define notation typeclasses for heterogeneous vector multiplication
      in Algebra.
* 2.) We define multiplicative typeclasses in Magma.
* 3.) We define semigroups as an extension of Mul.
* 4.) We define the basic operations in monoids in natural number operations.
* 5.) Monoids are semigroups with identity, so they naturally extend Semigroup
      and MulOneClass.
* 6.) To introduce inverses, we need to define operations over the integers.
* 7.) This allows us to define the middle of the road, DivInvMonoid and SubNegMonoid.
* 8.) We define groups as monoids with inverses, so Group extends DivInvMonoid,
      and AddGroup extends SubNegMonoid, by requiring that the `⁻¹` operation
      is an involutive inverse operation.
* 9.) From here we define semirings, rings, and fields, which gives us the necessary
      ingredients for a module, i.e., a commutative additive monoid of vectors
      with an action by some semiring.
* 10.) Vector spaces are modulees where the commutative additive monoid is a
      commutative additive group and the semiring is a field.

Math:

* Algebra:
  An algebra is a system A = [P, F] in which

    (i) P = {Sᵢ} is a family of nonempty sets Sᵢ of different types of
    elements, each called a phylum of the algebra A. The phyla are
    indexed by some set I.
    
    (ii) F = {fₐ} is a set of finitary operations, where each fₐ is a map
        fₐ : Sᵢ₍₁,ₐ₎ × ⋯ × Sᵢ₍ₙ₍ₐ₎,ₐ₎ → Sᵣ₍ₐ₎,
      where n(a) is a nonnegative integer, iₐ : k ↦ i(k,a) is a map from
      {1, ⋯ , n} to I, and r(a) ∈ I. The operations fₐ are indexed by some
      set Ω.
  
  A heterogeneous algebra is an algebra with more than one phylum.

  A homogeneous algebra is an algebra with exactly one phylum.

* Magma:
  A magma is a set M with a binary operation ⬝ : M × M → M. Magmas are used to
  define semigroups.

  An additive magma is a magma for which we think of the binary operation,
  denote +, as addition in some sense.

  A magma with zero is a magma M for which there exists an element 0 ∈ M such
  that 0 ⬝ x = 0 = x ⬝ 0 for all x ∈ M.

  A unital magma is a magma M with an element 1 ∈ M such that 1 ⬝ x = x = x ⬝ 1
  for all x ∈ M.

  An additive unital magma is a unital magma for which we think of the binary
  operation, denoted +, as addition in some sense.

* Semigroup:
  Semigroups are associative magmas. Semigroups are used to define monoids.

  A semigroup is a set S with a binary operation ⬝ : S × S → S such that
    (a ⬝ b) ⬝ c = a ⬝ (b ⬝ c)
  for all a, b, c ∈ S.

  An additive semigroup is a semigroup where we think of the binary
  operation, denoted +, as addition in some sense.

  A commutative semigroup is a semigroup such that
    a ⬝ b = b ⬝ a
  for all a, b ∈ S.

  An additive, commutative semigroup is an additive semigroup such that
    a + b = b + a
  for all a, b ∈ S.

* Monoid
  A monoid is a unital semigroup. Monoids are used to define groups.

  A monoid is a set M with a binary operation ⬝ : M × M → M such that the
  following hold:

  (i) We have
    (a ⬝ b) ⬝ c = a ⬝ (b ⬝ c)
  for all a, b, c ∈ M

  (ii) There exists e ∈ M such that e ⬝ a = a = a ⬝ e for all a ∈ M.
  
  An additive monoid is a monoid in which we think of the binary operation,
  denoted +, as addition in some sense.

  A commutative monoid is a monoid such that a ⬝ b = b ⬝ a for all a, b ∈ M.

  An additive commutative monoid is a commutative monoid in which we think of
  the binary operation, denoted +, as addition in some sense.

* Group
  A group is a semigroup with inverses.

* Semiring
  A semiring is a ring without inverses.

* Ring
  A ring is an abelian group under addition, a monoid under multiplication
  and has distributive laws.

* Field
  Fields generalize groups to things we are used to working with, e.g. ℚ and ℝ.

* Vector Space
  A vector space is an additive commutative group under addition acted upon by a
  field.
